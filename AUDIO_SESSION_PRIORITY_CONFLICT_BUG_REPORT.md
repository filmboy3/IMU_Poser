# Audio Session Priority Conflict Bug Report
**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Session:** session_20250906_101244_CA929B47  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Audio session transitions failing with priority conflicts

## Problem Summary
Despite implementing the new audio state machine architecture, the system is experiencing critical audio session priority conflicts when attempting to transition from recording to speaking sessions. The core issue is the `'!pri'` error (OSStatus 561017449) occurring during session category changes.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Session Category Transition Conflicts
The audio session manager is failing to transition from `.record` to `.playback` categories while the recording session is still active. This creates a priority conflict where iOS refuses to change the session configuration.

### Error Pattern
```
🔊 AudioSessionManager: Activating speaking session (current: recording)
AVAudioSessionClient_Common.mm:600   Failed to set properties, error: '!pri'
❌ AudioSessionManager: Failed to activate speaking session: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=561017449 "(null)"
```

**OSStatus 561017449** translates to `kAudioSessionIncompatibleCategory` - the system cannot switch from recording to playback while the recording session is active.

## Technical Analysis

### Voice Recognition Success ✅
- Voice commands "GO" and "STOP" are being detected correctly
- Speech recognition is working properly with the new recording session setup
- Audio input pipeline is functional

### TTS Failure Pattern ❌
1. Voice command triggers rep counting
2. AIVoiceCoach queues speech ("Workout started. Say 'GO' to begin reps.")
3. AudioSessionManager attempts to activate speaking session
4. **FAILURE**: Cannot transition from `.record` to `.playback` category
5. TTS is completely blocked - no audio coaching occurs

### Session Lifecycle Issue
The current implementation tries to change session categories without properly deactivating the recording session first:

```swift
// PROBLEMATIC: Trying to change category while recording is active
func activateSpeakingSession(completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil) {
    // This fails because recording session is still active
    try audioSession.setCategory(.playback, mode: .voicePrompt, options: [.duckOthers])
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### Functional Impact
- ✅ Voice recognition: Working
- ❌ AI coaching audio: Completely broken
- ❌ Rep count announcements: Silent
- ❌ Workout guidance: No audio feedback

### User Experience Impact
- Users can start/stop workouts with voice commands
- **Zero audio coaching feedback** during workouts
- Rep counting works but is silent
- Essentially a "mute AI coach" experience

## Detailed Log Analysis

### Successful Voice Recognition
```
🎙️ AudioSessionManager: Activating recording session (current: idle)
✅ AudioSessionManager: Recording session activated successfully
🎤 Voice command: GO - Starting rep counting
🎤 Voice command: STOP - Stopping rep counting
```

### Failed TTS Attempts (Every Single One)
```
🗣️ AIVoiceCoach: Processing speech: 'Workout started. Say 'GO' to begin reps.' (queue remaining: 0)
❌ AudioSessionManager: Failed to activate speaking session: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=561017449
🗣️ AIVoiceCoach: Processing speech: 'That's 1!' (queue remaining: 0)
❌ AudioSessionManager: Failed to activate speaking session: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=561017449
🗣️ AIVoiceCoach: Processing speech: 'That's 2!' (queue remaining: 0)
❌ AudioSessionManager: Failed to activate speaking session: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=561017449
```

### Session Deactivation Also Failing
```
🔇 AudioSessionManager: Deactivating session (current: recording) → idle
❌ AudioSessionManager: Failed to deactivate session: Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=560030580 "Session deactivation failed"
```

## Required Fix Strategy

### Phase 1.4: Proper Session Deactivation Before Category Change
The audio session manager needs to:

1. **Deactivate recording session completely** before attempting to activate speaking session
2. **Wait for deactivation to complete** before changing categories
3. **Handle the recording → speaking → recording cycle** properly
4. **Implement proper error recovery** when session changes fail

### Proposed Solution Architecture
```swift
func activateSpeakingSession(completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil) {
    // Step 1: Deactivate current session if active
    if currentState == .recording {
        deactivateSessionSync() // Synchronous deactivation
    }
    
    // Step 2: Set speaking category
    try audioSession.setCategory(.playback, mode: .voicePrompt, options: [.duckOthers])
    try audioSession.setActive(true)
    
    // Step 3: Update state
    currentState = .speaking
}
```

## Priority Level: CRITICAL
This bug completely eliminates the AI coaching functionality, which is a core feature of the app. While voice recognition works, users get no audio feedback, making the "AI Voice Coach" effectively non-functional.

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper session deactivation before category changes
2. Add synchronous session lifecycle management
3. Test recording → speaking → recording transitions
4. Verify TTS audio output on physical device
5. Validate complete audio coaching workflow

## Session Data
- **Duration:** 16.6 seconds
- **IMU Samples:** 1,658
- **Reps Detected:** 4 (but 0 recorded due to session issues)
- **Voice Commands:** 2 (GO, STOP) - both successful
- **TTS Attempts:** 4 - all failed with priority conflicts
