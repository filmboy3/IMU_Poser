Generated: 2025-09-06 18:23:22

## Model Configuration
- Architecture: 6 layers, 512 dimensions
- Vocabulary: 1088 tokens (1024 audio + 64 motion)
- Parameters: ~26.3M

## Test Results

### 1. Motion Primitive Consistency
- Total motion tokens: 403
- Unique primitives: 36
- Dominant coverage: 86.8%
- Status: ✅ PASS

### 2. Sequence Prediction Accuracy
- Accuracy: 0.701
- Predictions: 136/194
- Status: ✅ PASS

### 3. Motion State Transitions
- Generated sequence length: 51
- Unique transitions: 11
- Status: ✅ PASS

### 4. Rep Counting Patterns
- Sessions analyzed: 3
- Pattern detection: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Recommendations
1. Model shows good primitive learning
2. Prediction accuracy acceptable for early model
3. Transition patterns emerging
4. Rep counting validation requires ground truth audio data for full testing

## Next Steps
- Integrate audio tokenization for complete multimodal testing
- Expand training dataset with more diverse sessions
- Implement real-time inference pipeline
- Add coaching trigger detection
